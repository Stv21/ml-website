# --- WARNING: k-NN is VERY SLOW for large datasets like this! ---
# This code may take a long time to run the .predict() step.

# 1. Mount Google Drive and Load Data
# drive.mount('/content/drive')
# file_path = "/content/drive/My Drive/creditcard.csv" 
# df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
# print("Data loaded successfully.")

# 2. Prepare Data
# No categorical features, but we MUST scale everything
# X = df.drop('Class', axis=1)
# y = df['Class']

# 3. Split Data
# X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

# 4. Preprocessing
# scaler = StandardScaler()
# X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
# X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# 5. Initialize and Train Model
# model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
# model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# 6. Evaluate Model
# print("Predicting... This may take several minutes.")
# y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
# print("\nClassification Report (Focus on Recall for Class 1):")
# print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
