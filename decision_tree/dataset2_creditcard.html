# 2. Prepare Data
# No categorical features to encode. No scaling needed.
X = df.drop('Class', axis=1)

# --- CRITICAL: stratify=y ensures the imbalance is the same in train and test sets ---
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

# 4. Initialize and Train Model
# --- CRITICAL FOR YOUR EXAM ---
# We use criterion='entropy' for Information Gain.
# We use class_weight='balanced' to handle the severe imbalance.
# max_depth=10 is used to prevent the tree from becoming massive and overfitting.
