# 1. Mount Google Drive and Load Data
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# --- IMPORTANT: Update this path if different! ---
file_path = "/content/drive/My Drive/heart.csv" 

try:
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: File not found at {file_path}")
    exit()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    exit()

print("Data loaded successfully.")

# 2. Prepare Data
# Simple approach: drop any rows with missing values
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Define X (feature) and y (target)
# We will try to predict 'target' (heart disease) using only 'age'
X = df[['age']]
y = df['target']

# 3. Split Data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# 4. Feature Scaling
# Logistic regression benefits from scaling, as it helps the solver converge faster.
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test) # IMPORTANT: Only .transform on test data

# 5. Initialize and Train Model
# solver='lbfgs' is the default and a good all-rounder
model = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# 6. Get Results
intercept = model.intercept_[0]
coefficient = model.coef_[0][0]

print(f"\nModel Equation (Log-Odds): log(p/(1-p)) = {coefficient:.2f} * (scaled_age) + {intercept:.2f}")
print(f"Coefficient (β₁): {coefficient:.2f}")
print(f"Intercept (β₀): {intercept:.2f}")

# 7. Evaluate Model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"\nModel Performance on Test Set:")
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
print("\nConfusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
