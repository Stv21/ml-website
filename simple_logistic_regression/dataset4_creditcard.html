# 1. Mount Google Drive and Load Data
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# --- IMPORTANT: This path is based on your image ---
file_path = "/content/drive/My Drive/creditcard.csv" 

try:
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

print(f"Class distribution:\n{df['Class'].value_counts(normalize=True)}")

# 2. Prepare Data
# This dataset is very clean, no NaNs.
# For Simple Logistic Regression, we will predict 'Class' using only 'Amount'
X = df[['Amount']]
y = df['Class'] # Target is 'Class' (0 = No Fraud, 1 = Fraud)

# 3. Split Data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y) # stratify=y is CRITICAL for imbalance

# 4. Feature Scaling
# 'Amount' has a huge range, so scaling is essential.
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# 5. Initialize and Train Model
# --- CRITICAL: Use class_weight='balanced' to handle imbalance ---
model = LogisticRegression(random_state=42, class_weight='balanced')
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# 6. Get Results
intercept = model.intercept_[0]
coefficient = model.coef_[0][0]
print(f"\nModel Equation (Log-Odds): log(p/(1-p)) = {coefficient:.2f} * (scaled_Amount) + {intercept:.2f}")

# 7. Evaluate Model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"\nModel Performance on Test Set:")
print(f"--- WARNING: Accuracy is a misleading metric here! ---")
print(f"Overall Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
print("\nConfusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("\nClassification Report (Focus on Recall for Class 1):")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
